The [Purdue Digital Twin Lab](https://purduedigitaltwin.github.io/) aims to produce new insights into device-edge-cloud data-driven communicating frameworks and future transportation services, build digital replicas of real-world entities based on AI, big data, cloud/edge computing, and mixed reality. Our goal aims to create an environment with freedom and inclusion to explore newly generating thoughts and make outstanding contributions to our field or even the whole industry as research scientists.
